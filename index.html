      <p>I am a new developer that is eager to learn more technologies and further develop my coding skills.</p>

      <p>Learning new skills has always been a passion of mine so it was easy for me to fall in love with coding. I have also always loved solving puzzles and to me, coding is just like a puzzle where you create the pieces and put them together to develop any website, application, or program you can imagine.</p>
        
      <p>I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at UC San Diego Extension which has provided me with a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as well as a good understanding of Javascript and jQuery. I have experience creating responsive websites and basic Javascript games such as hangman. I hope to become a full stack or front end developer at a company after the completion of my program.</p>
